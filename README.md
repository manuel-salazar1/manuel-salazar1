### Hi there 👋


**manuel-salazar1/manuel-salazar1** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on adding some skills to my toolbox to help me manipulate the world around me. Thanks Codeup!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything and everything that I can. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything sports related. Most interested in NFL and NBA. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with life :)
- 💬 Ask me about almost anything! I'll let you know if I don't want to entertain your question. It's unlikely though!
- 📫 How to reach me: Search for me on LinkedIn or anywhere else you can find me. 
- 😄 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I ran my first marathon in Decemeber of 2022. It's was one of the hardest things I've ever done physically and I grew mentally!
